# A simple Pomodoro clock

(Part of [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) challenges)


This app was made using Jade(Pug), Sass (with bootstrap 4), and JavaScript (with jQuery). <br>

## What is this app?

This Pomodoro Clock is based on the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). <br>
It is a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. <br>
The timer has *2 phases*, usually a 25 minutes work phase , and a 5 minutes break phase. Theses phases are called *pomodoros*.

## How to use the clock?

The clock is designed to be as simple as possible. <br>
It has only 3 functions, play, pause, and stop. <br>
It contains the 2 basics phases of the Pomodoro Technique, a 25 minutes working phase, and a 5 minutes break phase. <br> <br>
Just press the play button and it will start the Pomodor cycles for you!
